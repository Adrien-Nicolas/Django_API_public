### Objectives

*This API aims to return and list all sports parks in France. 

*It is only the hidden part of the iceberg, as it is only half of a project called SportDehors 
(an application allowing a user to search for a sport park nearby).

### Features

The API can be requested to obtain the following data:

  *Sports parks (objects, coordinates, properties) according to their id
  *Sports parks (objects, coordinates, properties) according to their equipment types
  *Sports parks where their point coordinates are in a specified polygon (by entering 2 point coordinates in 2d)
  *The user profiles of the application
  *Comments from users of the application

                1.07627,
                44.63226
            ],
            "properties": {

            ],
            "properties": {

            },
            "type": "Spot_Point",
            "type_equipement": "Bassin ludique de natation"
        }
    ]

python manage.py populate_spot
```
You could find this command in API_APP/management/commands/populate_spot.py
